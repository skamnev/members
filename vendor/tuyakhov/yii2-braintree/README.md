Yii2-braintree
==============

Integrate a credit card payment form with Braintree's API into Yii2. Inspired by [braintreeapi](http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/braintreeapi/)


Installation
------------

The preferred way to install this extension is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).

Either run

```
php composer.phar require --prefer-dist tuyakhov/yii2-braintree "*"
```

or add

```
"tuyakhov/yii2-braintree": "*"
```

to the require section of your `composer.json` file.


Usage
-----

You should add Braintree component to your yii config first:

```
'components' => [
    'braintree' => [
        'class' => 'tuyakhov\braintree\Braintree',
        'merchantId' => 'YOUR_MERCHANT_ID',
        'publicKey' => 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
        'privateKey' => 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
    ],
]
```

Once the extension is installed, simply use it in your code by  :

`BraintreeForm` provide all basic operations for sales and stores customer info. Operation name equals scenario name. Available scenarios:
